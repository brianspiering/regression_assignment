San Francisco has been my home now for 30 years and I love my condo, my neighborhood and my city!  

I've lived in many places abroad and in the US but by far, San Francisco is my favorite place in the whole wide world.   

Having said that, I would like to visit the whole wide world!!  

I love to travel and enjoy meeting new and interesting people.  I am passionate about music and enjoy almost anything to do with the Arts.  On a cold rainy day I love a good book or movie.  I especially appreciate good company and good conversation but I also like my privacy and alone time. I am a foodie and am always looking for good restaurants or eateries and am blessed that San Francisco has many of these. 

I totally subscribe to living a sustainable life-style and appreciate if you join me in creating a greener planet.  California now suffers from frequent droughts so we are very conscientious here about not wasting water. I encourage my guests to conserve both water and energy, even during wet years. 

Suffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.

I am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.  All my bedding have hypo-allergenic encasings.   As a result I cannot accept guests with pets, even if they’re a service animal or emotional support pets.  

I would appreciate confirmed guests informing me in advance of their arrival and departure schedules so I can schedule the cleaners accordingly .   

My condo is on the second floor so my address is not going to be easily visible from the street level so please the directions to my place.  The entrance to my condo complex has a white wrought iron gate with Ripley Condominiums in the front.  You will need a key to enter the gate and my condo unit so communication and coordination is critical .   

Please do not bother neighbors when you arrive or during your stay.  

Thank You and looking forward to making your acquaintance.

Cecilia aka Gina

Me? 

University of Connecticut (UCONN) for learning, NYC for youthful playing and California for career, work and residing.

Music, theater, traveling and gardening are some of my passions.

A dog named Rocky is my most loyal and steady companion.

Favorite quotes are the ones related to the theme of 'repeating history.’

My Love of travel has led me to rediscover walking, (even between countries or small cities), like the walk to Santiago de Compostela from France to Northern Spain.  It is a different way to explore a country and its people.   It is great to venture into all the places that make a city or neighborhood alive.   However, make sure you have Siri with you, just in case, you get too lost! 

The city?

San Francisco is the most European of all cities in the United States. 
I’m sure you will enjoy it as much as I have for the past 30+ years.  

A city is only as dynamic as its people, and the tech revolution with its infusion of young adults have positively influenced San Francisco in wondrous ways.  For example, biking lanes in San Francisco have more than doubled since 2006 with protected bike lanes and closure of major portions of Market Street to allow for bike and public transportation traffic.  Plans are on the way to complete the San Francisco-to-Oakland Bay Bridge path way - it now reaches Yerba Buena Island. 

Restaurants and cafes?  We could write volumes about the explosion of such...

As a single, gay man, my heart and home have been anchored in San Francisco since 2002, and there is nowhere else I'd rather be. 

Travel and relocation have been prominent features of my life from an early age. I've lived in the Midwest and East Coast in the US as well as in Latin America, Western and Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. I was a university student in Spain, a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, and a humanitarian aid worker in Bosnia, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. 

I'm also an antiques dealer - for vintage, salvage, and upcycled furniture, decor, and jewelry. My home features many objects & artifacts I've collected or repurposed over the years. One of my favorite pastimes is poking around sidewalk sales and thrift stores... but some of my treasures were just as likely found 'free online' or on the street corner.

I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.

Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.

*As of April 15, 2021  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer vaccine two dose.
My guests should be too. 

Something about me and my home; I’m 63, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurers’ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for two years now and I have been redirecting my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner (online only these days).  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city. As of this Fall semester I am back to attending SF community college working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.
